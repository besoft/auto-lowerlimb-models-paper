# Time to generate the model for each processed dataset

These are roughly the times required to generate the models from the STL bone geometries. The total time required just for reading the geometry files is also reported.

| Dataset              | Time for importing the bone geometries [.stl] | Total time to generate the model |
| ---                  | ---                                        | ---                            |

# Notes to the gait simulations
Please note that:
* to avoid confounding effects from marker registration procedures, in the automatic model JIA-MRI we used the same virtual markers locations of the manual model. 
* the models employed in the simulations are the same stored in the `../opensim_models` folder, although both converted to the OpenSim 4.1 model format.
* the models used in the simulations have no geometry folder but can be easily modified for visualization purposes.

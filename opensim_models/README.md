# Notes about the OpenSim models

## Manual models
Manual models can be visualised with OpenSim 3.3. 
The bone geometries are binary vtp files and are NOT visible in OpenSim 4.0
The muscles and virtual markers have been removed from the original models.
These models were generated using NMSBuilder v1.0. The NMSBuilder files are
not shared because of their size (they include medical images).
The complete OpenSim models and the NMSBuilder models can be obtained 
contacting the corresponding author of the publication.

## Automatic models
Automatic models can be visualised with OpenSim 4.1. 
The bone geometries are ASCII files in OBJ format. If they are not present 
in the repository, they will be generated by a_createOsimModels.m during 
the creation of the models from the matlab triangulations included in 
the ./bone_geometries folder.
